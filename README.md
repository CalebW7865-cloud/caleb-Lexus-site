# Caleb — Lexus of Clearwater (Personal Site)
A simple, clean one‑page site you can deploy in minutes.

## Quick Start
1. Open `script.js` and set:
   - `phoneNumber`, `smsNumber`
   - `bookingURL` (Calendly or similar)
   - `reviewURL` (Google Reviews link)
2. Replace placeholder images in `/assets`:
   - `hero-lexus.jpg` (wide showroom shot)
   - `is350.jpg`, `rx350.jpg`, `gx550.jpg`, `og-image.jpg`, `favicon.png`
3. Deploy free with **Netlify** or **Vercel**:
   - Drag-and-drop the entire folder to Netlify (app.netlify.com) or run `vercel` if using their CLI.
4. Set your domain:
   - Buy something like `caleblexus.com` and point DNS to your host, or use the free subdomain they provide.

## Notes
- The contact form uses a `mailto:` action by default. For a real form handler, connect Netlify Forms or Formspree.
- Update copy (About, Inventory) to match your current offers and incoming units.
- Add your QR code to business cards linking to this site.
